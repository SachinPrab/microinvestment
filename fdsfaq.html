In case of premature withdrawal, the interest on your FD will be paid not as per the original rate of interest but as per the rate applicable to the date of the deposit.<br>

For instance, you opened an FD account on 1 June 2013 for 4 years at 8%. Due to some reason, you want to close your fixed deposit account after one year on 1 June 2014. At the time of opening of your FD, the interest rate applicable for one year FD was 7.5%. So when you close the account, you will earn interest at 7.5% per annum on your deposits and not at the original rate of 8%.<br>
